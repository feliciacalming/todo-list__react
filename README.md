# To Do List
A To Do List built with React.js and TypeScript. You can add tasks (that are stored in your local storage), mark them as done and remove them. When you add a new task, or mark one as done, 
the app will automatically sort the list so the completed tasks are in the bottom and the unfinished tasks in the top, also sorted by the time they were created. If you unmark a task, 
it will appear in the top amongst the unfinished ones again.
